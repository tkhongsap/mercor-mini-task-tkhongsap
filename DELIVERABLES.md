# Mercor Mini-Interview Task - Deliverables Summary

This document summarizes all deliverables for the Mercor Mini-Interview Task as specified in the PRD.

## Project Overview

A complete Airtable-based data model and automation system that:
1. Collects contractor application data through multi-table forms
2. Compresses data from multiple tables into JSON format
3. Decompresses JSON back to normalized tables for editing
4. Auto-shortlists candidates based on multi-factor rules
5. Uses OpenAI LLM to evaluate and enrich applications

## Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
```
User Forms → Airtable Tables → Compression Script → Compressed JSON
                                                           ↓
                                                    Evaluation Scripts
                                                           ↓
                                            ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
                                            ↓                             ↓
                                   Shortlist Evaluator            LLM Evaluator
                                            ↓                             ↓
                                   Shortlisted Leads        LLM Summary/Score/Follow-Ups
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for each concern (compression, decompression, shortlisting, LLM)
2. **Flexible Interface**: Both CLI and standalone scripts for different use cases
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Retry logic, validation, comprehensive logging
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to modify criteria, add new features
5. **Security First**: No hardcoded secrets, proper validation

## Performance Considerations

- **API Rate Limits**: Sequential processing to avoid rate limit errors
- **Token Budgets**: Limited tokens per LLM call to control costs
- **Smart Caching**: Skip LLM evaluation if JSON unchanged
- **Batch Operations**: Support for processing multiple applicants

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for production use:
- Webhook server for real-time processing
- Database caching for faster lookups
- Multi-currency support with exchange rates
- More sophisticated experience calculation
- Email notifications for shortlisted candidates
- Dashboard for analytics and reporting

- Multi-table Airtable schema with proper relationships
- Complete data compression and decompression
- Rule-based candidate shortlisting
- LLM-powered evaluation and enrichment
- Comprehensive documentation
