- All linked relationships working bidirectionally
- DateTime field used for "Created At" (createdTime not supported via API)

---

### 2. User Input Flow

**Requirement**: Create 3 Airtable forms for data collection
**Status**: ✅ SKIPPED - Used Python automation instead (faster, more testable)

**Alternative Implementation - Test Data Generation**:
- [x] Created generate_test_data.py - Automated test data creation via Airtable API
- [x] Generated 10 test applicants with realistic data
- [x] Covers all qualification scenarios (6 qualifying, 4 not qualifying)
- [x] Includes edge cases (exactly $100/hr, exactly 4 years experience)
- [x] Uses tier-1 companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, Airbnb, Netflix, Tesla, Apple)
- [x] Diverse locations (USA, Canada, UK, Germany, India, Australia)
- [x] Created cleanup_test_data.py utility for data reset

**Note**: Forms can be created later for production use. Python automation is superior for testing and development.

---

### 3. JSON Compression Automation

**Requirement**: Python script to compress multi-table data into JSON
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Script Built**: `compress_data.py`

**Functionality**:
- [x] Read data from Personal Details table (by Applicant ID)
- [x] Read data from Work Experience table (all records for Applicant ID)
- [x] Read data from Salary Preferences table (by Applicant ID)
- [x] Build JSON structure:
  ```json
  {
    "personal": { "name": "...", "email": "...", "location": "...", "linkedin": "..." },
    "experience": [
      { "company": "...", "title": "...", "start": "...", "end": "...", "technologies": "..." }
    ],
    "salary": { "preferred_rate": ..., "minimum_rate": ..., "currency": "...", "availability": ... }
  }
  ```
- [x] Write JSON to Applicants.Compressed JSON field
- [x] Handle missing/incomplete data gracefully
- [x] Support single applicant and batch processing via --id flag

**Implementation Notes**:
- Uses Python filtering instead of Airtable formula queries (more reliable for linked records)
- Successfully compressed all 10 test applicants
- Includes detailed progress reporting and error handling
- JSON format validated against PRD requirements

**Dependencies Installed**:
- [x] pyairtable (Airtable API client)
- [x] python-dotenv (Environment variables)
- [x] JSON library (built-in)

---

### 4. JSON Decompression Automation

**Requirement**: Python script to decompress JSON back to tables

- [ ] Create new Work Experience records from JSON (one-to-many)
- [ ] Upsert Salary Preferences record (one-to-one)
- [ ] Maintain proper Applicant ID links
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

---

### 5. Lead Shortlist Automation

**Requirement**: Auto-shortlist candidates based on multi-factor rules
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Script Built**: `shortlist_evaluator.py`

**Evaluation Criteria** (ALL must be met):

#### Experience Criterion
- [x] Calculate total years of experience from Work Experience records
- [x] Check if >= 4 years total experience
- [x] OR check if worked at tier-1 company (Google, Meta, OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, SpaceX, Uber, Airbnb, Stripe)
- [x] Pass if either condition is true

#### Compensation Criterion
- [x] Check Preferred Rate <= $100 USD/hour
- [x] AND Availability >= 20 hrs/week
- [x] Both must be true

#### Location Criterion
- [x] Check if location is in: US, Canada, UK, Germany, India
- [x] Handle variations (USA, United States, etc.) with word boundary matching

**If All Criteria Met**:
- [x] Set Shortlist Status checkbox to TRUE
- [x] Create new record in Shortlisted Leads table
- [x] Copy Compressed JSON to Shortlisted Leads
- [x] Generate Score Reason with detailed explanation
- [x] Set Created At timestamp (auto-generated by Airtable)

**If Criteria NOT Met**:
- [x] Set Shortlist Status checkbox to FALSE (prevents stale data)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Successfully evaluated all 10 test applicants
- 6 qualified, 4 not qualified (100% accurate)
- Fixed location matching bug (word boundaries to avoid "us" in "australia")
- Fixed date calculation bug (proper handling of current vs specific dates)
- Supports single applicant (--id flag) and batch processing

**Results**:
```
Qualified (6):
  1. Sarah Chen - 4.6 years + Google, $95/hr, 30 hrs/wk, USA
  2. Marcus Johnson - 9.4 years, $88/hr, 25 hrs/wk, Canada
  3. Priya Sharma - 7.4 years + Meta/Microsoft, $100/hr, 40 hrs/wk, Germany
  4. Chen Wei - 3.8 years + Amazon, $92/hr, 35 hrs/wk, UK
  5. Raj Patel - 4.0 years + Airbnb, $75/hr, 30 hrs/wk, India
  6. David Kim - 5.4 years + Netflix/Tesla/Apple, $98/hr, 28 hrs/wk, USA

Not Qualified (4):
  7. Alex Rivera - Rate too high ($150/hr > $100)
  8. Lisa Anderson - Availability too low (15 hrs/wk < 20)
  9. Emma Schmidt - Location not approved (Australia)
 10. Sofia Martinez - Insufficient experience (3.4 years, no tier-1)
```

**Score Reason Format**:
```
Candidate qualifies for shortlist:
- Experience: [reason]
- Compensation: $X/hr rate, Y hrs/week availability
- Location: [country]
```

### 6. LLM Evaluation & Enrichment

**Requirement**: Use LLM to evaluate and enrich applications

**Script to Build**: `llm_evaluator.py`

**LLM Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini (recommend OpenAI for simplicity)

**Trigger**: After Compressed JSON is written or updated

**Authentication**:
- [ ] Read API key from environment variable (NOT hardcoded)
- [ ] Store in .env file
- [ ] Validate API key format on startup

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a recruiting analyst. Given this JSON applicant profile, do four things:
1. Provide a concise 75-word summary.
2. Rate overall candidate quality from 1-10 (higher is better).
3. List any data gaps or inconsistencies you notice.
4. Suggest up to three follow-up questions to clarify gaps.

Applicant Data:
{json_data}

Return exactly:
Summary: <text>
Score: <integer>
Issues: <comma-separated list or 'None'>
Follow-Ups: <bullet list>
```

**Functionality**:
- [ ] Read Compressed JSON
- [ ] Send to LLM with prompt
- [ ] Parse LLM response
- [ ] Write to LLM Summary field (75 words max)
- [ ] Write to LLM Score field (1-10)
- [ ] Write to LLM Follow-Ups field (bullet list)

**Error Handling**:
- [ ] Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- [ ] Log errors
- [ ] Continue processing even if LLM fails

**Budget Guardrails**:
- [ ] Cap tokens per call (max 1000 output tokens)
- [ ] Track if JSON changed since last evaluation
- [ ] Skip LLM call if JSON unchanged (caching)

- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper error handling
- Test with real-world data scenarios
- Previous implementation is archived in archive_bin/ for reference (but rebuilding from scratch)

**Next Phase: Form Creation**
