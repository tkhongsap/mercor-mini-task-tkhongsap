### 6. LLM Evaluation & Enrichment

**Requirement**: Use LLM to evaluate and enrich applications

**LLM Provider**: OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini (recommend OpenAI for simplicity)

**Trigger**: After Compressed JSON is written or updated

**Authentication**:
- [ ] Read API key from environment variable (NOT hardcoded)
- [ ] Store in .env file
- [ ] Validate API key format on startup

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are a recruiting analyst. Given this JSON applicant profile, do four things:
1. Provide a concise 75-word summary.
2. Rate overall candidate quality from 1-10 (higher is better).
3. List any data gaps or inconsistencies you notice.
4. Suggest up to three follow-up questions to clarify gaps.

Applicant Data:
{json_data}

Return exactly:
Summary: <text>
Score: <integer>
Issues: <comma-separated list or 'None'>
Follow-Ups: <bullet list>
```

**Functionality**:
- [ ] Read Compressed JSON
- [ ] Send to LLM with prompt
- [ ] Parse LLM response
- [ ] Write to LLM Summary field (75 words max)
- [ ] Write to LLM Score field (1-10)
- [ ] Write to LLM Follow-Ups field (bullet list)

**Error Handling**:
- [ ] Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- [ ] Log errors
- [ ] Continue processing even if LLM fails

**Budget Guardrails**:
- [ ] Cap tokens per call (max 1000 output tokens)
- [ ] Track if JSON changed since last evaluation
- [ ] Skip LLM call if JSON unchanged (caching)

- All field types validated against PRD requirements
- Bidirectional linked relationships verified
- DateTime field used for "Created At" (createdTime not supported via API)

**General Guidelines:**
- No emojis allowed per PRD requirements
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper error handling
- Test with real-world data scenarios
- Previous implementation is archived in archive_bin/ for reference (but rebuilding from scratch)

**Next Phase: Form Creation**
- Create 3 Airtable forms (Personal Details, Work Experience, Salary Preferences)
- Configure form flows and prefill options
- Test data submission workflow
